less than a month after developing this, openai created chatgpt which is vastly superior than my little script so this is now archived

# OpenAI Chatbot
This script is acting as a simple 'wrapper' for OpenAPI. It allows a user to communicate with OpenAI's artifical intelligence api, which is an extraodinarily phenomonal piece of technology which can often replicate texts of real people. Ask the AI questions like "how was your day?" or more complex questions like "whats the quadratic formula?". 
# Up and Running
* Download the repo.
* Unzip it (if you need to).
* Edit **settings.json**.
* Download python (if necessary, developed on 3.10.7).
* Run the script in python.
* Speak to your new friend with a brain bigger than your public library!
# Future Plans
I hope to work on this script in the future to create a front end UI. I've attached a visual sketch of what I hope the script can one day become in the github repository. (god the css needed for that makes me want to cry already)
